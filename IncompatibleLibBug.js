This error occurs when you are using a third-party library that is not compatible with the version of React Native you are using. This can cause unexpected behavior, such as crashes or incorrect rendering.

For example, if you are using a library that requires React Native 0.60 or higher, but you are using React Native 0.59, you will get this error. Another example is using a library that has not been properly updated to support iOS 15 or Android 12.
