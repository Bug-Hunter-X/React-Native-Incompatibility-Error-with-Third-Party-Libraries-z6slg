The solution depends on the specific incompatibility.  Here are some common approaches:

1. **Check Library Compatibility:** Carefully review the third-party library's documentation to ensure it supports your current React Native version and the target operating system (iOS and Android versions). 
2. **Update React Native:**  If the library requires a newer version of React Native, consider upgrading your project.  This often involves significant changes and requires thorough testing.
3. **Update the Library:** Check if a newer version of the library exists that resolves the incompatibility. Use npm update or yarn upgrade to update the library. 
4. **Use a Compatible Alternative:** If updating is not feasible, explore alternative libraries that offer similar functionality and are compatible with your React Native environment. 
5. **Downgrade:** In rare cases, downgrading the library or React Native might be necessary, but this is generally not recommended unless the library maintains backward compatibility for older versions. 

Example of checking compatibility (in `IncompatibleLibSolution.js`):

```javascript
// ...other code
const isCompatible = checkCompatibility(reactNativeVersion, libraryVersion, osVersion); 
if(!isCompatible){
  // Handle compatibility issue:  show an alert, use a fallback component etc. 
}
// ...rest of the code 
```
